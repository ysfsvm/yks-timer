YKS TIMER is a handy gnome shell extension that displays the remaining time until the YKS (Yükseköğretim Kurumları Sınavı) exam, which is a national higher education entrance exam in Turkey. With this extension, you can easily keep track of the time left until the exam day right from your panel.

The countdown is displayed in the panel, so it doesn't take up space on your desktop and is always easily accessible.
